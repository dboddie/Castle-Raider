Sound
-----

According to the Electron Advanced User Guide (page 212), the counter at 0xfe06
can be used to generate sounds when bit 1 of 0xfe07 is set. The formula for
calculating the frequency using the counter value, v, is as follows:

    frequency = 1000000 / (16 * (v + 1)) Hz

If we know the frequency we want, the value required can be determined using
the formula:

    v = 1000000 / (16 * frequency) - 1

According to Wikipedia [1], the first A above middle C is 440 Hz, so the value
required to generate this note is

    v = 1000000 / (16 * 440) - 1
    v = 141

We can generate values for many of the standard notes using another formula [2]
from Wikipedia:

    f(n) = 2**((n - 49)/12) * 440 Hz

where n = 49 is the first A above middle C, which is itself n = 40.
