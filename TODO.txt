To Do

Add support for plotting the view onto the level from any point in the level.
Ensure that the player simply falls when colliding with scenery when both
moving horizontally and falling.
Add half vertical tile movement (4 pixels) for the player's character and
update jumping and falling motion to use it.
Expand the number of rows in the playing area so that the player's character
can roam along the top of the level if necessary. Perhaps add 4-8 more rows
without scenery.
Add support for non-scenery objects in the plotting routines.
