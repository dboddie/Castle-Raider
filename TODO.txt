To Do

Replace the level row offsets with level row addresses since we can calculate
them in advance.
Ensure that the player simply falls when colliding with scenery when both
moving horizontally and falling.
Add half vertical tile movement (4 pixels) for the player and update jumping
and falling motion to use it.
Add support for scenery/span modification, using reversible actions that can be
triggered at certain points on the level.
