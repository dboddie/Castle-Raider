Two banks, one is one scroll step ahead of the other. Each bank scrolls by two
scroll steps.

We only plot the edges between tiles, so the bank swapping has to produce the
effect of scrolling spans of tiles. If we only used one bank, the tiles would
have to be uniform in colour to avoid giving the effect that spans of tiles are
static.

In principle, other scroll steps could be used.

Smoother scrolling means fewer cells to update for bank 1.

If there is no need to write to a cell to "finalise" it as part of a span, as
there is in games like Moon Raider that use EOR to paint the tile that makes up
a hill until it becomes a solid block of colour, then each cell only needs to
be updated once in each bank.

However, since there are only two banks, the pattern used must be repeated for
twice the number of pixels in each scroll step, so a single pixel scroll
results in tiles with 2 pixel wide patterns, typically resulting in 2 x 2 sized
patterns.
