Castle Raider

As the sun dips below the ramparts of the old town, the last of the troops file
in. As they make their way through the narrow, cobbled streets, small groups of
them quietly slink away into the many taverns that give this district its bad
reputation. The lamps are lit and the merriment spills out onto the streets
with laughing, singing, pushing and shoving. There will be trouble later, but
by then you will be long gone.

It is time for the guard to change, time for the night watch to begin their
duties, but they are in no hurry; though the outlaws in the countryside know
the force stationed here will be no threat tonight, they gave them a wide
berth during their march here. The people in the nearby villages can sleep
soundly for a change.

One of the members of the watch begins to slowly climb the stairs to the top
of the wall; the others crowd together by the guard house, conducting some kind
of business with a few of the new arrivals. Taking your chance, you slip
through the open gate and take refuge in the long shadows fleeing the sunset.
The few eyes looking in your direction are hardly able to make out your form
as you wait for the approaching nightfall.

You recall the stories told when you were young. When the town itself was old,
the last of the elders told of a time when it was still a village, not much
more than a few houses and shelters. The road that ran through it went to the
castle on the edge of the wasteland that now lies derelict and deserted.

Night falls quickly in this season at the edge of the kingdom. Memories of
fireside tales about the king's lost crown and the hidden treasure of the old
kingdom make the journey across the plains more bearable. Soon you arrive at
the outer fortifications. Crossing a bridge, you enter. As you pass beneath the
outer gate it suddenly crashes into place, cutting off your exit. It was just
as well you hadn't planned to return that way.

Nature has reclaimed parts of the castle for itself, its ruins crumbling in
places and crawling with creatures that people once knew well to leave alone.
To make your way through it to the lands beyond, you will need to unlock the
few doors and gates that still stand. Perhaps the folk tales were true and
the king's treasure still remains, but survival is more important here. If you
live to leave the outer gate then the story alone will have made the journey
worthwhile.
